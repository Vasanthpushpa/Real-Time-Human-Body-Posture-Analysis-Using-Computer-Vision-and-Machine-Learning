# Real-Time-Human-Body-Posture-Analysis-Using-Computer-Vision-and-Machine-Learning
## Title of the Project
### Real-Time-Human-Body-Posture-Analysis-Using-Computer-Vision-and-Machine-Learning
We are developing a system to assess and monitor human posture in real-time using computer vision techniques like OpenCV and MediaPipe. 

## ABOUT
This project aims to create an innovative system for analyzing and monitoring human body posture in real-time. By leveraging advanced computer vision techniques (OpenCV, MediaPipe) and machine learning models, this system detects and tracks body landmarks through live video feeds. It evaluates posture, provides instant visual feedback, and identifies deviations or incorrect alignments. The project addresses applications such as fitness training, rehabilitation, workplace ergonomics, and general posture correction, offering an accessible and automated solution for posture monitoring using standard webcams.

## FEATURES
The Real-Time Human Body Posture Analysis System is designed to provide an innovative solution for posture monitoring using advanced computer vision and machine learning technologies. This system operates in real-time, leveraging frameworks like OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect and track body landmarks through live video feeds. It evaluates posture accuracy, identifies deviations, and provides instant visual feedback to guide users in maintaining proper alignment. The system is versatile, with applications in fitness training to improve exercise form, rehabilitation to assist with physical therapy, and workplace ergonomics to promote healthier sitting and standing habits. Its accessibility is a key feature, as it works with standard webcams, eliminating the need for specialized equipment. Additionally, the system can be customized with alerts, recommendations, and optional data logging features for progress tracking and advanced analysis, making it an effective and user-friendly tool for posture correction and health improvement.

## Results and Impact
This project delivers significant results and impacts across multiple domains. By accurately detecting and analyzing body postures in real time, it enhances posture awareness and correction, enabling users to achieve better alignment during activities like fitness training, rehabilitation, and daily work. The systemâ€™s instant feedback mechanism ensures timely guidance, helping users avoid posture-related injuries and long-term musculoskeletal issues.
 
The implementation of standard webcams and user-friendly interfaces makes the solution accessible to a wide audience, reducing the dependency on costly or specialized equipment. In fitness, it aids individuals in maintaining proper form during exercises, leading to more effective workouts. In physical therapy and rehabilitation, it supports therapists by automating posture assessment and providing real-time progress tracking. Additionally, in workplace ergonomics, the system promotes healthier work habits by alerting users to improper seating or standing postures, ultimately improving productivity and reducing work-related discomfort.

Overall, the project contributes to health and wellness by addressing critical posture-related challenges, empowering users with automated, real-time assistance, and paving the way for further advancements in posture monitoring technology.
